# SongBook

Songbook is the ultimate notebook for songwriters to have all the tools they need in one application to let their creativity flow. It includes a canvas to be used with an apple pencil as a space to write lyrics, chords, and notes as you create. The right side of the screen has “widgets” to aid in the creative process which include the KeyWidget, RecordWidget, and DrumWidget. The key widget has a dropdown to choose a major key. Then you can see all of the guitar tabs along with the number of each chord in the key. Each image is also a button you can press to hear the chord played out loud. Below the images is another picker with some common chord progressions. If you click on the numerical progression, it will show the respective chords for your selected key. The recorder widget records your jam as you experiment with ideas and play them back. The DrumWidget lets you experiment with different how different beats fit into your songwriting vision.
